This repo contains my work for the Dog Breed Classifier Project from Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree. In this project, I have learned how to build algorithms to process real-world, user-supplied images with both transfer learning using pre-trained models as well as building a CNN model from scratch. Given a dog's image, the algorithm will identify the dogâ€™s breed and if given an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I have made important design decisions about the user experience for the dog app. By completing this lab, I understood the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.
